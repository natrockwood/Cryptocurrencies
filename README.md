# Cryptocurrencies

As there are many cryptocurrencies in the present day, this project was created to present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing nw cryptocurrencies.

Using unsupervised learning, I've grouped the cryptocurrencies using a clustering algorith to help determine about investing in this product. 

I've also used various data visualization guides to help share my findings.
